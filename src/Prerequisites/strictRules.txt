Always give full code to replace whatever is in the file that is being modified. Do not give code snippets to insert into existing files instead rewrite the entire code and give as it will be easy to copy paste.

Always show github path of the file that is being modified or created. Never give code without specifying in which file it is to be pasted.
Table name and column name are case sensitive in supabase. They have to be in double quotes.

Approach the design into manageable bits and build features slowly, step-by-step and without causing errors.
